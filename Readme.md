Created by Daniel Kravec, on July 8, 2021

# Description
This website is simple. You provide a photograph of your choice, and press submit. This will draw the image onto a smaller canvas. 
- You can hover over the canvas to see the RGB and HEX value of the pixels you are hovering over.
- You may press "get all colours", this will parse through the canvas and get all the colours. Then will display the colours in a list.
